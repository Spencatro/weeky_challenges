# Week 6: Flatland Space Station

Challenge proposed 3/13, due 3/16

-----------------------------------------------------------

> Flatland is a country with `n` cities, `m` of which have space stations. Each city, `ci`, is numbered with a distinct index from `0` to `n-1`, and each city `ci` is connected to city `ci+1` by a bidirectional road that is `1 km` in length.
> 
> For example, if `n=5` and cities `c0` and `c4` have space stations, then Flatland looks like this:

>
> For each city, determine its distance to the nearest space station and print the maximum of these distances.
