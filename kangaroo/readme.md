# Week 1: Kangaroo

Challenge proposed 2/6, due 2/9

-----------------------------------------------------------

> There are two kangaroos on a number line ready to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward ). Each kangaroo takes the same amount of time to make a jump, regardless of distance. That is, if kangaroo one jumps 3 meters and kangaroo two jumps 5 meters, they each do it in one second, for example.
> Given the starting locations and jump distances for each kangaroo, determine if and when they will land at the same location at the same time.
