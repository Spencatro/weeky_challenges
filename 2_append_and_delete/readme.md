# Week 2: Append and Delete

Challenge proposed 2/13, due 2/16

-----------------------------------------------------------

> You have a string, ``s``, of lowercase English alphabetic letters. You can perform two types of operations on ``s``:
> 1. Append a lowercase English alphabetic letter to the end of the string.
> 2. Delete the last character in the string. Performing this operation on an empty string results in an empty string.
> Given an integer, ``k``, and two strings, ``s`` and ``t``, determine whether or not you can convert  to  by performing exactly  of the above operations on s. If it's possible, print Yes; otherwise, print No.
