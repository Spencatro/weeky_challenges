# Week 2: Append and Delete

Challenge proposed 2/13, due 2/16

-----------------------------------------------------------

> You have a string, ``s``, of lowercase English alphabetic letters. You can perform two types of operations on ``s``:
> 1. Append a lowercase English alphabetic letter to the end of the string.
> 2. Delete the last character in the string. Performing this operation on an empty string results in an empty string.
> Given an integer, ``k``, and two strings, ``s`` and ``t``, determine whether or not you can convert  to  by performing exactly  of the above operations on s. If it's possible, print Yes; otherwise, print No.


Notes:
- LOL, run your submission against hackerrank. You'll probably be surprised how wrong your first attempt is
- Don't blindly assume you got it right on your own. Test your code. Accept others' edge cases, if they think of them.
- Read the whole problem before you start working on a solution. Read all the examples.
    - alt: maybe failing fast is also useful?
